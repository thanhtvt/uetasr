/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0001.flac 12.195 without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself an illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0002.flac 8.78 in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbe conti and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0003.flac 21.48 madam corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word scevra which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced sceura and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0004.flac 16.46 her face was an enigma for it inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0005.flac 18.54 silvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marivaux for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0006.flac 23.74 silvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0007.flac 12.49 two years before her death i saw her perform the character of marianne in the comedy of marivaux and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0008.flac 23.86 she was honourably buried in the church of saint sauveur without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christain intolerancy of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was the common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0009.flac 18.31 you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of silvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor silvia dies

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0023.flac 8.185 my remark pleases him but i soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0024.flac 5.515 i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still and looking up
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0025.flac 3.0 is there not a meridian everywhere
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0026.flac 4.69 yes but the meridian of the palais royal is the most exact
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0027.flac 3.0 that is true badauderie
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0028.flac 5.265 all these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0029.flac 8.605 it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the civet cat
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0030.flac 2.84 is it better than anywhere else
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0031.flac 4.4 but how did she manage to render it so fashionable
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0032.flac 13.64 simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her snuff box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0033.flac 28.575 you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of wit
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0034.flac 18.895 let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0035.flac 20.65 it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0036.flac 5.24 when the king comes to paris everybody calls out vive le roi

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0040.flac 10.66 for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0041.flac 10.895 i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0042.flac 15.165 i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0045.flac 20.375 he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty repartees and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/3729/6852/3729-6852-0046.flac 12.605 his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0000.flac 2.645 miss lake declined the carriage to night
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0001.flac 3.47 and he added something still less complimentary
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0002.flac 5.125 but don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0003.flac 2.865 in the meantime i had formed a new idea of her
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0004.flac 9.225 by this time lord chelford and wylder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of general ship
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0005.flac 4.59 and he made a little dip of his cane towards brandon hall over his shoulder
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0006.flac 4.215 yes so they said but that would i think have been worse

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0010.flac 15.03 well you know radie women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i'm sure from what bracton has said to me i know him intimately that dorcas likes him and i can't conceive why they are not married
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0011.flac 7.37 their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0012.flac 8.26 now that's impossible radie for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0013.flac 9.93 there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0014.flac 3.97 don't insult me stanley by talking again as you did this morning
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0015.flac 2.83 what i say is altogether on your own account

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0018.flac 5.455 to my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0019.flac 20.855 the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep mouthed malignities in every new born generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and a special satanic action
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0020.flac 3.93 the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0021.flac 7.9 my bed was unexceptionably comfortable but in my then mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0022.flac 3.19 its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0023.flac 2.745 all the furniture belonged to other times
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0024.flac 9.855 i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0025.flac 3.47 i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0026.flac 2.34 i boldly lighted my cheroot
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0027.flac 4.755 a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0028.flac 5.62 the sombre old trees like gigantic hearse plumes black and awful
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0029.flac 2.275 somehow i had grown nervous
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0030.flac 4.845 a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0000.flac 8.92 it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redman's farm
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0001.flac 3.66 well she was better though she had had a bad night
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0002.flac 11.085 so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0003.flac 9.345 women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0004.flac 11.21 but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0005.flac 6.11 this transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0006.flac 11.99 there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0007.flac 6.795 rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0008.flac 2.95 you have been so ill my poor rachel

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0010.flac 7.75 poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0011.flac 9.21 she spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0012.flac 4.38 thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0016.flac 10.185 and the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0020.flac 6.545 and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0021.flac 4.09 dorcas in her strange way was moved

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.flac 3.62 but i do not think such an inference is warranted

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.flac 11.845 there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.flac 18.145 it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.flac 7.835 if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.flac 6.56 remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0022.flac 6.44 some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.flac 6.265 in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.flac 6.34 the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.flac 21.78 we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.flac 9.3 this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.flac 3.88 it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.flac 11.69 it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.flac 14.51 whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.flac 7.555 thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.flac 22.49 we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.flac 16.695 there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.flac 14.945 the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.flac 18.76 thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
