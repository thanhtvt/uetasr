/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0000.flac 9.995 at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0001.flac 6.64 we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0002.flac 5.09 at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0003.flac 4.43 then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0004.flac 2.81 in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0005.flac 7.035 there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head it didn't sound good
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0006.flac 2.77 when a man breathes that way he's mostly all gone
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0007.flac 2.91 men got batted over the head often enough in those days
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0008.flac 4.68 sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but it's no soothing syrup
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0009.flac 12.675 their coffin was their ship and their grave it was the sea blow high blow low what care we and the quarter that we gave them was to sink them in the sea down on the coast of the high barbaree
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0010.flac 14.92 it fair made my hair rise to hear him with the big still solemn desert outside and the quiet moonlight and the shadows and him sitting up straight and gaunt his eyes blazing each side his big eagle nose and his snaky hair hanging over the raw cut across his head
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0011.flac 5.405 however i made out to get him bandaged up and in shape and pretty soon he sort of went to sleep
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0012.flac 8.675 then again he'd sing that barbaree song until i'd go out and look at the old colorado flowing by just to be sure i hadn't died and gone below or else he'd just talk
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0013.flac 5.325 he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0014.flac 7.705 i used to listen by the hour but i never made out anything really important as to who the man was or where he'd come from or what he'd done
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0015.flac 2.905 i didn't pay any attention to him for he was quiet
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0016.flac 5.755 usually i didn't bother with his talk for it didn't mean anything but something in his voice made me turn
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0017.flac 6.68 he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0018.flac 3.18 where are my clothes he asked very intense
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0019.flac 3.61 one little squeeze talk about your deadly weapons
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0020.flac 2.7099375 but he'd been too sick and too long abed
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0021.flac 2.32 in a minute or so he came to
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0022.flac 5.675 now you're a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0023.flac 3.025 they're safe enough let me have them he begged
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0024.flac 4.06 now look here said i you can't get up to day you ain't fit
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0025.flac 3.12 i know he pleaded but let me see them
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0026.flac 3.445 just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0027.flac 2.56 i've been robbed he cried
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0028.flac 2.175 where's my coat he asked
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0029.flac 2.885 you had no coat when i picked you up i replied
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0030.flac 5.75 he looked at me mighty suspicious but didn't say anything more he wouldn't even answer when i spoke to him
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0031.flac 2.52 after he'd eaten a fair meal he fell asleep
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0032.flac 3.32 when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0033.flac 2.235 i didn't see him again for two days
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0034.flac 2.135 then i caught sight of him quite a ways off
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0035.flac 6.83 guess he suspicions i stole that old coat of his thinks i and afterwards i found that my surmise had been correct
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0036.flac 2.825 however he didn't stay long in that frame of mind
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0037.flac 2.075 i ran up pulling my gun
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0038.flac 3.055 the mex was flat on his face his arms stretched out
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0039.flac 2.535 on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0040.flac 5.915 anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colt's into the sailor's face what's this i asked
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0041.flac 4.52 i ween heem at monte off antonio curvez said he
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0042.flac 3.31 the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0043.flac 4.25 in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0044.flac 6.3 during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs i saw him off and on
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0045.flac 6.26 however i didn't pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0046.flac 3.68 that's all right said i but you better stay right there
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0047.flac 2.8 i want to make up to you for your trouble said he
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0048.flac 3.9550625 what kind of a good thing i asked treasure said he
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0049.flac 3.17 he looked all right enough neither drunk nor loco
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0050.flac 3.97 sit down said i over there the other side the table
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0051.flac 3.205 he did so now fire away said i
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0052.flac 6.455 and it's a big thing said handy solomon to me for they's not only gold but altar jewels and diamonds
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0053.flac 4.58 it will make us rich and a dozen like us and you can kiss the book on that
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0054.flac 3.53 that may all be true said i but why do you tell me
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0055.flac 3.185 why don't you get your treasure without the need of dividing it
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0056.flac 3.335 why mate he answered it's just plain gratitude
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0057.flac 4.12 didn't you save my life and nuss me and take care of me when i was nigh killed
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0058.flac 12.47 look here anderson or handy solomon or whatever you please to call yourself i rejoined to this if you're going to do business with me and i do not understand yet just what it is you want of me you'll have to talk straight
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0059.flac 3.575 it's all very well to say gratitude but that don't go with me
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0060.flac 3.425 the devil's a preacher if you ain't lost your pinfeathers said he
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0061.flac 4.855 well it's this then i got to have a boat to get there and she must be stocked
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0062.flac 4.45 and i got to have help with the treasure if it's like this fellow said it was
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0063.flac 6.39 it's money i got to have and it's money i haven't got and can't get unless i let somebody in as pardner
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0064.flac 3.095 why me i asked why not he retorted
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0065.flac 2.01 we talked the matter over at length
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0066.flac 2.075 i stood out for a larger party
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0067.flac 9.625 he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country finally we compromised
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88294/6841-88294-0068.flac 8.205 a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the men whom i should select this scheme did not appeal to him
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0000.flac 8.4 but since there existed for us no responsibility we each reported dutifully at the roll call of habit and dropped back into our blankets with a grateful sigh
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0001.flac 16.265 i remember the moon sailing a good gait among apparently stationary cloudlets i recall a deep black shadow lying before distant silvery mountains i glanced over the stark motionless canvases each of which concealed a man the air trembled with the bellowing of cattle in the corrals
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0002.flac 4.225 seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0003.flac 11.77 three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before that took up about half the men
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0004.flac 2.805 the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0005.flac 5.72 we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0006.flac 6.8 between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0007.flac 2.265 we pushed open the wide gate and entered
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0008.flac 4.89 one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0009.flac 4.805 all the rest squatted on their heels along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0010.flac 4.705 the first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0011.flac 3.76 homer wooden and old california john rode in among the cattle
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0012.flac 5.29 as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0013.flac 7.23 homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0014.flac 2.325 nobody paid any attention to the calf
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0015.flac 6.13 behind him followed his anxious mother her head swinging from side to side near the fire the horse stopped
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0016.flac 3.1 the two bull doggers immediately pounced upon the victim
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0017.flac 2.73 it was promptly flopped over on its right side
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0018.flac 2.275 thus the calf was unable to struggle
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0019.flac 6.2449375 when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a rib or two broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0020.flac 2.89 hot iron yelled one of the bull doggers
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0021.flac 2.15 marker yelled the other
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0022.flac 2.685 the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0023.flac 2.84 perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0024.flac 5.27 the brand showed cherry which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0025.flac 2.325 then he nicked out a swallow tail in the other
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0026.flac 5.815 it seems to me that a great deal of unnecessary twaddle is abroad as to the extreme cruelty of branding
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0027.flac 8.795 undoubtedly it is to some extent painful and could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0028.flac 3.955 inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through arizona
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0029.flac 6.325 imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0030.flac 7.11 a calf usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0031.flac 8.305 besides which it happens but once in a lifetime and is over in ten seconds a comfort denied to those of us who have our teeth filled
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0032.flac 6.985 one of the little animals was but a few months old so the rider did not bother with its hind legs but tossed his loop over its neck
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0033.flac 4.43 mister frost's bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0034.flac 9.745 and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0035.flac 7.725 as he knew his business and as the calf was a small one the little beast went over promptly bit the ground with a whack and was pounced upon and held
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0036.flac 5.695 he would catch himself on one foot scramble vigorously and end by struggling back to the upright
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/6841/88291/6841-88291-0037.flac 2.09 you can imagine what happened next

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0001.flac 5.44 a part of that impression was due to the engagement which he must now fulfil

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/4515/11057/4515-11057-0003.flac 14.605 because in his salad days he dallied with a girl who had indeed many charms step by step he had come to the necessity of sacrificing his prospects to that raw attachment

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0002.flac 6.475 therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him
/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0003.flac 6.04 secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior

/work/hpc/iai/thanhtvt/LibriSpeech/dev-other/7697/245712/7697-245712-0008.flac 6.995 this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
